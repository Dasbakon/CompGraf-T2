# Ds

Ds is an Open Source C++ class library for [OpenGL]-based graphics application
development. It contains classes and templates for math objects (vectors,
points, quaternions, and transformations), spatial data structures (grids,
trees, and bounding volume hierarchies), scene graph management ([Unity]-like
scene object hierarchy and components such as triangle meshes, lights, and
cameras), and basic [OpenGL] rendering and ray-tracing support, among others.

Ds has been employed in the teaching of subjects such as computer graphics,
visualization, and games, in undergraduate and graduate courses of Computer
Science at the [Faculty of Computing](https://www.facom.ufms.br) of the
[Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul](https://www.ufms.br). Ds has
also been used in several research projects in physics-based animation
and geometric processing.

## Compiling Ds

The current master version is 1.0 and supports Windows 10 and later. All
headers and source files are in the [cg/](/cg) folder. The only dependencies
are [GLFW] and [Dear ImGui]. All headers, source files, and libraries needed
are already included in the [cg/externals/](/cg/externals) folder.
The project file for Visual Studio 2019 is located in the
[cg/build/vs2019/](/cg/build/vs2019) folder. There is also a pre-compiled
binary available in the [cg/lib/](/cg/lib) folder.

## Demo

Ds Demo is a simple ray-tracing application built on top of Ds. The headers,
source files, and a Windows binary are available in the
[apps/cgdemo/](/apps/cgdemo) folder. The Solution and project files for
Visual Studio 2019 are in the
[apps/cgdemo/build/vs2019](/apps/cgdemo/build/vs2019).

The ray-tracing relies on bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) for accelerating
ray/object intersections. Also, the code includes a scene reader with a LL(1)
parser. The grammar for the specification of a scene and its scene objects is
[here](/apps/cgdemo/reader/grammar.txt). The scene file shown in this example
is available [here](/apps/cgdemo/assets/scenes/).

## Upcoming Changes

Some of the goals for 2022 are:

- Full API documentation
- CMake project and support for macOS and Linux with Clang and GCC
- Textured ans transparent materials
- Basic scientific visualization API
- Demos for 2D/3D neighbor particle searching with regular grids and
quadtrees/octress
- BÃ©zier and B-spline curves and surfaces rendering API
